  <h2>A place I world like to visit</h2>
    <p>If I could visit anywhere in the world, I would like to go to Korea. I love Korean culture so much. I experienced Korean culture by the computer. I listened to their music and their entertainment shows from the internet world. But I never actually been that place which makes me really want to go there and take a look not only from the computer screen but ACTUAL take a look.</p>
